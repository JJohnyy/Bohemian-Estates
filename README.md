this poject was created in VScode 


# Inroduction
 
  I decided to create web for company I work for. It is easy for me to understand the problem and presentation.
  this is link to our official website: www.bohemianestates.com

  
Bohemian Estates is about managing properties to its full potentieal
There are total of 4 pages: 
* home page 
  * contains hero image 
  * basic inforamtion about company
  * main goal is to lead a visitor to contact form

* product page - about main product - guaranteed rent 
  * contains basic image
  * all necessary information about main product
  * basic contact form- this is part of the page where visitor could leave his/her contacts

* contact form 
  * only purpose of this page is to get a form submitted from a new visitor - to get a lead

* contacts for the company and branches
  * contains all contact and other necessary, legal information about the company


# Process
  * I first built all pages for PC version and started to create responsivness where I realized project was built wrongly and cannot be finished this way, or at least woud be very difficult. 

  * So I started again, this time from mobile version and continued to bigger sizes, this method proved to be very efficient and I was able to finish quite quickly.

  * After finishing this process I finally watched Portfolio 1 lessons where I realized I could have saved myself alot of time. 
  * This is where I found out the page has to go thru validators and lighthouse, where I found out my project is full of bugs and mistakes, so I had to basically rebuilt some parts of the project to be able to continue.  
  * **I will watch necessary instructions before I start my next project, I promise :)**


# Site goals

* **First time visitor goals**
  * first time visitor will be led to form where he will leave his contact details
  * the visitor should be well informed about a product th e company offers from product page
  * another goal fot hte first time visitor is to get an impression company is well established and experienced

# Testing 

* page was tested in different browsers and sizes
* friends and family members were asked to review the page and give feedback on issues and bugs


# Known bugs

* There is a bug in contact section where, on mobile device submit button is displayed with different border radius
