# Bohemian Estates

this poject was created in VScode 


# Inroduction
 
  I decided to create web for company I work for. It is easy for me to understand the problem and presentation.
  this is link to our official website: www.bohemianestates.com

  
Bohemian Estates is aboout managing properties to its full potentieal
There are total of 4 pages: home page, product page - about main product - guaranteed rent. contact form and contacts for the company and branches


# Process
  I first built all pages for PC version and started to create responsivness where I realized project was built wrongly and cannot be finished this was, or at least woud be very difficult. So I started again, this time from mobile version and continued to bigger sizes, this method proved to be very efficient and I was able to finish quite quickly.

  Affer finishing this process I finally watched Portfolio 1 lessons where I realized I could have saved myself alot of time. This is where I found out the page has to go thru validators and lighthouse, where I found out my project is full of bugs and mistakes, so I had to basically rebuilt some parts of the project to be able to continue.  I will watch necessary instructions before I start my next project, I promise :)


# Page goals

* **First time visitor goals**
  * first time visitor will be led to form where he will leave his contact details
  * the visitor should be well informed about a product th e company offers from product page
  * another goal fot hte first time visitor is to get an impression company is well established and experienced


# Resposivness
All 4 pages were tested in responsivness in chrome-developer tools and also in ami.resposivedesign
